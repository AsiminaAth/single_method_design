1. Describe the Problem

As a user
So that I can improve my grammar
I want to verify that a text starts 
with a capital letter and ends with 
a suitable sentence-ending punctuation mark.


2. Design the Method Signature

# def grammar_improve(text)
    report = grammar_improve(text)
    text: a string
    report: true (verified as correct) or false (verified as wrong): return value


3. Create Examples as Tests

grammar_improve("Hi there!") => [true]
grammar_improve("hi there!") => [false]
grammar_improve("Hi there") => [false]
grammar_improve("hi there") => [false]
grammar_improve("") => throw exception: "No text found"


4. Implement the Behaviour

After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
